      "I discovered my passion for technology at the age of 12, when I began creating user layouts and websites for an online game I enjoyed. Through experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a genuine enthusiasm for web development that would stay with me throughout my life. Although I initially pursued a career in law enforcement, driven by a strong sense of justice, I eventually felt compelled to return to computer science.",
      "This blend of law enforcement experience and technical curiosity sparked my fascination with cybersecurity. As I furthered my studies, I took part in numerous Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, honing my skills in vulnerability detection and exploitation. In addition, I manage the Discord server for my universityâ€™s computer science program, which grew to over 2,100 members under my supervision. These experiences have allowed me to combine my commitment to justice with my passion for technology in a truly meaningful way.",
